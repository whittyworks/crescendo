# Crescendo starter site

This is a no-build, single-folder starter you can deploy anywhere (GoDaddy static hosting, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.).

## Edit quickly
- Change text in `index.html`.
- Tweak colors in `styles.css` under `:root` variables.
- Replace `images/saint-gallery-placeholder.jpg` with your collage or remove the image block.
- Swap the logo in `logo.svg` (keeps the same size).

## Forms
Right now forms show a friendly alert. To make them send emails:
- **Easiest:** use Formspree or Basin. Replace `action="#"` with their endpoint and remove the `onsubmit` handlers.
- **Google Forms:** link a button to a form for signups.

## Deploy
- **GitHub Pages:** Create a repo, upload these files, turn on Pages (root). Done.
- **Netlify / Vercel:** Drag-and-drop the folder into their dashboard.
- **GoDaddy / cPanel:** Upload this whole folder into `public_html` (or similar).

## Favicons
Replace `favicon.png` with your own 512×512 PNG. Use https://realfavicongenerator.net/ to generate a full set later.

Blessings on your launch!
